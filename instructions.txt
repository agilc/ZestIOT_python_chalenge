The python code parses through the json files within a dictionary and stores the information in a dictionary for easier access.
The latest snapshots corresponding to each UUID has been stored as well.

The steps to run the python code is as follows :

 Step 1.	Extract all the json files and place it in a directory (/home/agil/intern || or do change the path to the directory       in the python code.)
 
 Step 2.	Place the python code in the same directory.
 		      Ensure the permissions are set so that the python code can be executed.
 		
 Step 3.	Execute the python code : python file.py
 
 Step 4.	The output will be displayed on the terminal.
